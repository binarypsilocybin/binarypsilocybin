I'm a passionate and curious frontend engineer with an eagerness to learn and grow. I'm always exploring new technologies, building projects, and pushing the boundaries of what I can create.

🚀 Currently working with:

    Three.js – Diving deep into 3D web development and interactive graphics.
    Node, GraphQL, Next.js, and D3– Expanding my backend skills and data visualization capabilities.

🔍 On my radar:
Always looking for the next challenge, whether it's experimenting with new frameworks, contributing to open source, or building projects that push the limits of the web.
