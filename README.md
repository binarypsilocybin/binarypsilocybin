I'm a passionate and curious frontend engineer with an eagerness to learn and grow. I'm always exploring new technologies, building projects, and pushing the boundaries of what I can create.

🚀 Currently exploring and learning:

    Three.js – Diving deep into 3D web development and interactive graphics.
    Node, GraphQL, Next.js, and D3– Expanding my backend skills and data visualization capabilities.

🔍 On my radar:

    React Performance – Optimizing for speed and scalability in React applications.
    Architecture Patterns – Learning best practices for building maintainable and scalable applications.
    Design Systems – Crafting cohesive and reusable design systems for better consistency and efficiency.
    Product Lifecycle – Understanding the full cycle of a product, from ideation to development and beyond.
🌱 Personal Life:
    
    When I’m not coding, you can find me studying and playing chess, running on trails, or reading about history. I love the mental challenge of chess, the peace of trail running, and diving into the stories of the past.
